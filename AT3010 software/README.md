Android APK, no google store (China has blocked google play store), manufacturer provided the APK for download upon request, but BLUETOOTH connection is not ok. why ?  

Manufactuer is telling, to uses Android app and tap on bluetooth icon within the app, no need connection with control panel uses. PC interface, win10, uses control panel to connect bluetooth device first, passcode is "1234", not "0000", and then open the application program, select COM port, usually there are two COM port exhbited, select the first one whatever, job will be done. the JDY-23 BLE module is working as UART (serial) port, pumping data to phone/PC, nothing special. However, there is no any uesr manual or serial procotol, reverse engineering could be easy to see the streaming data. Power metering solution is very common today, total solution and cloud/app are key to scusses on big revenue.
